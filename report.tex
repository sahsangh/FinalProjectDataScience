\section{Introduction}
Credit card fraud represents a significant challenge in the financial industry, with fraudulent transactions causing billions of dollars in losses annually. This project focuses on developing an effective machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. We implement a supervised learning approach using classification algorithms to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

We plan to solve this problem by developing a machine learning pipeline that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Processes and transforms transaction features to improve model performance
    \item Handles the severe class imbalance inherent in fraud detection
    \item Optimizes detection thresholds to balance precision and recall
    \item Evaluates performance using metrics appropriate for imbalanced classification
\end{itemize}

Our approach relates to the techniques discussed in lectures on handling imbalanced datasets, feature engineering, and model evaluation, particularly focusing on the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.

\section{Motivation}
The importance of this project lies in the financial industry's critical need for robust fraud detection systems. Credit card fraud detection presents several unique challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class imbalance - fraudulent transactions typically represent less than 1\% of all transactions
    \item Feature complexity - transactions contain numerous features requiring careful preprocessing
    \item Cost-sensitivity - false negatives (missed fraud) and false positives (legitimate transactions classified as fraud) have different associated costs
\end{itemize}

Existing questions in this area include how to effectively balance precision and recall, how to optimally set decision thresholds, and how to handle evolving fraud patterns over time.

Prior work in this field includes research by Dal Pozzolo et al. (2015) on handling concept drift in fraud detection, Bhattacharyya et al. (2011) on comparative performance of various machine learning methods for fraud detection, and Bahnsen et al. (2016) on cost-sensitive approaches to fraud classification. These works highlight the importance of considering both algorithm performance and business impact when designing fraud detection systems.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Dataset}
We used the September-2013 credit card transaction dataset from European cardholders, publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains transactions over a two-day period, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions (0.172\% fraud rate).

\subsection{Data Format}
The data is in tabular format with the following features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction
    \item Amount: Transaction amount
    \item V1-V28: Principal components obtained from PCA transformation (for confidentiality)
    \item Class: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Steps}
Our implementation followed these key steps:

\subsubsection{Data Preprocessing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chronological splitting of data into train (60\%), validation (20\%), and test (20\%) sets to simulate real-world deployment
    \item Log-transformation and standardization of the Amount feature to handle skewness
    \item Conversion of Time to hours from the first transaction
    \item Standardization of numerical features
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Selection}
We implemented and compared several classification algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
    \item Random Forest
    \item XGBoost
\end{itemize}

The models were trained with class weighting to address the severe class imbalance in the dataset.

\subsubsection{Threshold Optimization}
Instead of using the default 0.5 classification threshold, we optimized the threshold using the validation set based on a cost-weighted F-score that accounts for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item False positive cost: Customer inconvenience and operational costs
    \item False negative cost: Financial losses from fraud
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Methodology}
We evaluated our models using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Precision-Recall curves and Area Under PR Curve (AUPRC)
    \item ROC curves and Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC)
    \item Cost-weighted metrics to account for the business impact of different error types
    \item Confusion matrices to visualize classification performance
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Model Performance}
Our final XGBoost model achieved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AUROC: 0.982 on the test set
    \item AUPRC: 0.876 on the test set
    \item Precision: 0.83 at the optimized threshold
    \item Recall: 0.79 at the optimized threshold
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Importance}
Analysis of feature importance from our XGBoost model revealed that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item V17, V14, V12, and V10 were among the most important features for fraud detection
    \item The transformed Amount feature also played a significant role
    \item Time feature had moderate importance, confirming our hypothesis about temporal patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Visualization}
Our visualization of results included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ROC curves comparing different models
    \item Precision-Recall curves highlighting the trade-off between these metrics
    \item Confusion matrices at different threshold values
    \item Feature importance plots
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison to Baseline}
The XGBoost model significantly outperformed our baseline logistic regression model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 7\% improvement in AUROC
    \item 12\% improvement in AUPRC
    \item 15\% reduction in estimated fraud-related costs
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Expected vs. Actual Results}
We expected that ensemble methods would outperform simpler models, which was confirmed by our experiments. However, the magnitude of improvement from feature engineering, particularly the log transformation of Amount and the conversion of Time to hours, was greater than anticipated.

We initially expected higher recall rates, but discovered that achieving high recall inevitably led to significantly increased false positives, which would be problematic in a production environment. The optimal threshold based on our cost-weighted metric provided a more balanced approach that would be suitable for real-world implementation.

\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}
Several challenges were encountered during this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The extreme class imbalance required careful handling to prevent model bias
    \item Limited interpretability of the PCA-transformed features (V1-V28) made domain-specific analysis challenging
    \item The dataset covered only two days, limiting our ability to detect longer-term fraud patterns
    \item Real-world deployment would require additional considerations for concept drift as fraud patterns evolve
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
Future improvements to our fraud detection system could include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of anomaly detection techniques as a complementary approach
    \item Exploration of more sophisticated handling of temporal patterns
    \item Integration of customer profile data to improve detection accuracy
    \item Development of an online learning approach to adapt to evolving fraud patterns
    \item Testing more sophisticated ensemble methods and deep learning approaches
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Our credit card fraud detection system demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in addressing this critical financial security challenge. The combination of appropriate preprocessing, model selection, and threshold optimization resulted in a system that balances the competing objectives of fraud detection and minimizing false alarms.

The project successfully implemented the concepts discussed in class regarding imbalanced classification, evaluation metrics, and the importance of considering business impact beyond pure algorithm performance. The resulting system provides a solid foundation for fraud detection that could be further enhanced and deployed in real-world financial environments.
